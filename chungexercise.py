#Define the model architecture: You need to define the neural network architecture that will learn to recognize emotions from images. A common architecture for image classification is a convolutional neural network (CNN).

#Compile the model: After defining the model architecture, compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics. The categorical_crossentropy loss function is commonly used for multi-class classification problems.

#Train the model: Train the model on the training set using the fit method. You can use callbacks like EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.

#Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set using the evaluate method. This will give you an idea of how well the model generalizes to new data.

#Fine-tune the model: Based on the evaluation results, fine-tune the model by changing the architecture or hyperparameters.

#Test the model: Finally, test the performance of the model on the test set using the predict method. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the model.

#Save the model: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, save the model using the save method. You can use the saved model to make predictions on new images.
